            <p class="firstLine">Have you ever secretly wished you could live the life of your dreams?</p>
                <p class="secondLine">I know that feeling all too well. Lacking a stable family situation as a child, I grew up bouncing back and forth
                    between relatives, friends, and other temporary homes. Without a safe (STABLE) place to stay throughout my
                    childhood, my grandmother’s house was the closest to a “home” I ever had. It was not until I grew older that
                    I realized home is not about where you are, but who you are. To be more precise, it is about the person you
                    choose to be.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have learned that living a fit and healthy life is more than just looking good on the outside. It is about slowly
                    carving out the best  version of yourself with a combination of dedication and faith, and sticking with your
                    goals even when things get tough.</p>
